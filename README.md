# Maze-Runner-Solver
Takes in a picture of a maze and solves it using an AI method


The Maze Runner project solves code using different AI techniques to get from one point on a given picture of a maze
to get from the entrance of the maze to the end in the quickest amount of time. 

This was a final project for my Artifical Intelligence Class and I decided to use one of the AI techiques that I learned for solving map and graph related
problems to solve the maze. The user must click the start of the maze and the 4 corners of the maze so the program can detect how to solve it.

If you would like to see a complete explantation of the project and the results of the project, please feel free to check out the Final Lab Report for 
the project or if you have any question or improvements feel free to reach out by messages or email.
