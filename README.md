# Maze-Runner-Solver
This project is designed to take in a picture of a maze and use AI techniques to solve it. The solution is then outputted as a series of steps that can be followed to navigate the maze.

To use the maze solver, you will need to have Python 3 and the following dependencies installed:

NumPy
OpenCV

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the root directory. From there, you can run the maze solver by using the following command:

python main.py 
<path_to_maze_image>

The maze solver will then process the image and output the solution in the form of a series of steps.

We hope you find this project helpful and enjoyable to use! If you have any issues or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the GitHub page.
